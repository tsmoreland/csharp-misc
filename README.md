# Moreland.CSharp.Util

Utilty object library provided generic support types such as results, optionals, etc.. for use in other software packages

## Result Types

3 result types: ```QueryResult<T>```, ```CommandResult```, and ```CommandAndQueryResult<T>```; ```CommandAndQueryResult<T>``` violates CQS but is provided because while command query seperation should be strived for it's not always possible with given code.

## Support Classes

- ```Maybe<T>``` a C# equivalent of java.util.Optional<T>
- NumericParser, class providing MaybeParse...() methods with the same similar 
- HashCodeBuilder; builder which creates a HashCode for multiple values, similar to ```HasCode.Combine<T1>(T1 value)``` available in newer versions of .NET (dotnet standard 2.1+)
