# Authorization Demo

Intended to be small and simple API supporting multiple authorization handlers with fallback, likely including less than ideal 
authentication methods such as basic but ideally with scopes that limit what those authorization types can do

In a nutshell the idea is the more secure the auth type the more access is gained
