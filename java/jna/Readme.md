# Sample JNA application

The following is reasonable small demo using JNA to access Win32 MessageBox using java 9 module with services

## Debugging notes

As of yet I haven't been able to launch this from Intellij - it runs but fails to locate the services.  I have however
had success using visual studio code with module paths, presumably it'd be something similar in Intellij.

I've added launch.json.sample which is a copy of launch.json that I've used to debug the application
